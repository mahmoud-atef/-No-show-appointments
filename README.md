# Medical Appointments

# Introduction
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment.


I used No-show appointments dataset What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment? There are many factors such as :
1.Gender
2.Age
3.Scholarship
4.Hipertension
5.Diabetes
6.Alcoholism
7.SMS_received

# Conclusions
In conclusion we investigate seven factors which are related to the dataset and our dataset has unrealistic values such as negative age so we drop those values. then we started to explore it to answer our initial question which it was 'What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment? ' and we found out that
there are four factors which affect the appointments:

1.SMS_received
Its percentage equals about 30%

And the others factors almost don't affect the appointments:

1.Gender
2.Scholarship
3.Alcoholism
4.Diabetes
5.Age
6.Hipertension
